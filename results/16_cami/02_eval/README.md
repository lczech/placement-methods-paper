Overview
==================

The main OPAL output files are in `opal_output_both.tar.gz`.

As OPAL ranks the tools relative to each other, the evaluation changes depending on which tools are included.
We thus also provide `opal_output_unconstr.tar.gz`, which only evaluates the unconstrained tree.

The two profiles used as input for OPAL, as well as the command to run it, are also provided here.
