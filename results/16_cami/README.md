Overview
==================

Here, we provide the full results of using our trees for taxonomic profiling,
evaluated in terms of the CAMI challenge.

 * `00_data` contains copies of the reference alignment and trees used for placing the CAMI data.
 * `01_process` is the whole processing pipeline, as described in our supplement.
 * `02_eval`, and there, particularly `opal_output_both.tar.gz` contains the resulting html file with all evaluation results and metrics.
