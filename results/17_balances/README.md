Overview
-------------------------

The directory contains scripts and result files of our adaptations
of the PhyILR transformation and Phylofactization to phylogenetic placement data.
Many of the subdirectories contain dirs named `tw` and `no_tw`, which stand
for the two variants with taxon weighting and without (no) taxon weighting.

 * `bv_place`: Evaluation of placeing the BV dataset on their ref tree, then
   running our adapations on it.
