 * `corr_test` contains the tests for the correlation of balances with nugent score of the BV dataset.
   This was to investiage the whole lot of red (anti-correlated) branches in S13 Fig.
 * `no_tw` and `tw` are the evaluations without and with taxon weighting of the BV dataset.
 * `nugent_tw` is a small test to see how just using the nugent score changes the results.
